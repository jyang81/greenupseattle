# Green Up! Seattle

#### *10 teams of Seattle neighborhoods compete for the title of "Greenest Hood" by playing a waste sorting game to earn points for their team! 

### Motivation

With a partner, I created Green Up! Seattle because I noticed people were always stalling in front of the waste bins trying to figure out whether their trash goes in the garbage, recycling, or compost. Half of the time, they would end up putting it in the wrong bin. I wanted to create an app that would educate people who live and work in Seattle to properly dispose of their trash, but in a fun way.

By offering an incentive (such as 20% off their recycling bill), users would be encouraged to participate and earn points for their team, as well as recruit others to play. Through repeat exposure to common waste items, people would learn to put their waste in the right place! 

### Overview

All of the waste items used in the game were taken directly from the city of Seattle's waste guidelines.
